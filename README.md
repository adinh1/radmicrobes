# RAD microbes
2023 RAD microbes boot camp

DATES: December 14-15, 2023
LOCATION: BRC 280 | 6500 Main St., Houston, TX 77030

SUMMARY: Computational analyses of microbial genomes through genomic sequencing hold tremendous promise yet can become riddled with various sources of potential bias. The microbial genome analysis workshop is designed for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and investigators from diverse backgrounds and interests for clarity on how to effectively utilize ubiquitous computational pipelines for answering specific research questions. This hands-on workshop will cover end-to-end microbial genome analysis, discussing the pros and cons of decisions made during the process (library preparation, sequencing, bioinformatic tool selection, parameter settings, and interpretation of results).

TOPICS: Short and long-read sequencing, amplicon and isolate genome sequence, genome assembly and validation, functional annotation, phylogenomic analysis, and strain typing. This workshop will be taught by scientists with expertise in bioinformatics and analysis of clinical samples, allowing participants to get individualized training on how to accurately sample, sequence, and characterize microbial genomes.

## Instructors

### Dr. Rodrigo de Paula Baptista, PhD

Rodrigo Baptista is researcher with 13 years of expertise in the realms of eukaryotic pathogens and bioinformatics. His extensive experience includes a notable focus on parasite genomic data, particularly in the realms of Trypanosomatids and Apicomplexan parasites. Over the last few years, Baptista has cultivated specific proficiency in evolutionary genomics and the analysis of highly repetitive genomes and transcriptomes. His skill set encompasses tasks ranging from assembly and annotation to variant calling, and the identification and characterization of duplications and repetitive elements within these genomes. He has contributed significantly to the field by assembling and annotating numerous protozoan parasite genomes using various sequencing platforms, such as paired-end Illumina, Ion-Torrent short reads, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore long-reads. These efforts have resulted in published data accessible to the scientific community. As a bioinformatician, he has established collaborations with research groups worldwide, working across diverse areas including protozoan parasites, prokaryotes, and vectors. Currently, at the Houston Methodist Research Institute, he leads the genomics enterprise within the Center for Infectious Diseases, focusing on employing genomics to characterize antibiotic resistance in clinical bacterial infections and eukaryotic pathogens. The primary goal is to mitigate the emergence and spread of resistant pathogens induced by treatment interventions.
