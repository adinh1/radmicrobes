# RAD microbes
2023 RAD microbes boot camp

DATES: December 14-15, 2023
LOCATION: BRC 280 | 6500 Main St., Houston, TX 77030

SUMMARY: Computational analyses of microbial genomes through genomic sequencing hold tremendous promise yet can become riddled with various sources of potential bias. The microbial genome analysis workshop is designed for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and investigators from diverse backgrounds and interests for clarity on how to effectively utilize ubiquitous computational pipelines for answering specific research questions. This hands-on workshop will cover end-to-end microbial genome analysis, discussing the pros and cons of decisions made during the process (library preparation, sequencing, bioinformatic tool selection, parameter settings, and interpretation of results).

TOPICS: Short and long-read sequencing, amplicon and isolate genome sequence, genome assembly and validation, functional annotation, phylogenomic analysis, and strain typing. This workshop will be taught by scientists with expertise in bioinformatics and analysis of clinical samples, allowing participants to get individualized training on how to accurately sample, sequence, and characterize microbial genomes.
