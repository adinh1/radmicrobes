## Genomic Epidemiology
John Snow (1813 - 1858), an English physician who pioneered many anesthesia practices in the 19th century, has been ascribed as the founder of traditional epidemiology due to his work studying the London cholera outbreaks that occurred in the mid 19th century. Prior to the widespread acceptance of germ theory that began to take hold in the late 19th century, the conventional wisdom of the time were that many diseases, including cholera, were due to 'foul air' or pollution (*i.e.*, miasma theory). John Snow was able to deduce through classic epidemiogical tracing of deaths/attacks due to cholera that cholera deaths were 14 times higher near the Broad street waterpump compared to other waterpumps that served as water sources throughout London. He documented these deaths using a dotmap, where stacked bars served as a visual tool to indicate higher frequency of deaths in a particular location:
